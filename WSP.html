To provide accurate QoS  values for service selection, user-side QoS prediction thus  becomes an important research problem. Although collaborative ﬁltering based prediction approaches have been studied in several previous works, these methods suffer from the  limitation of the sparsity of available historical QoS data,  which greatly degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this  problem, this paper proposes a Web service positioning (WSP)  framework for response time prediction, which is one of the  most important QoS properties. In our approach, a small set of  landmarks are deployed to periodically monitor the response  times of the Web service candidates and provide references  to the numerous service users. By combining the advantages  of network coordinate based approaches and collaborative  ﬁltering based approaches, the response times between users  and Web services can be accurately predicted using their  corresponding Euclidean distances. Extensive experiments are  conducted based on our real-world QoS dataset collected on  PlanetLab, comprising about 359,400 response time values  from 200 users on 1,597 Web services. The experimental results  show that our WSP approach outperforms the other existing  approaches, especially when the historical data is sparse.</p>   Read more about our paper: [<a href="http://jiemingzhu.github.io/pub/jmzhu_icws2012.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a>][<a href="http://jiemingzhu.github.io/pub/jmzhu_icws2012_slides.pptx" target="_blank">Slides</a>]  <br><br>   <h2>Dataset </h2>  <p>This dataset is collected via the PlanetLab platform on Dec. 5 in 2011, comprising the RTTs between 200 distributed PlanetLab nodes and 1,597 Web services and also the RTTs between the 200 Planetlab nodes.
