However, modelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box services remain an open problem. Software services, such as Web services and Web APIs, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the Internet, leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability analysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only on the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g., service workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models become ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by black-box services, in this paper, we propose CARP, a context-aware reliability prediction approach that leverages historical usage data from users for reliability prediction. Through context-aware model construction and prediction, CARP is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily limits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches. The preliminary evaluation results show that CARP can make significant improvement on reliability prediction accuracy, e.g., 41% for MAE and 38% for RMSE when only 5% of data are available.<br><br>  Read more about our paper: [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00102v1" target="_blank">PDF</a>]  <br><br> <h2>Dataset</h2> <p/>The data used in our work is a publicly-released reliability dataset.
