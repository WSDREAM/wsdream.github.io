To make timely and accurate adaptation  decisions, effective QoS prediction is desired to obtain current  QoS values of component services, but it has not been well  studied by the previous work. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel QoS prediction approach, namely adaptive  matrix factorization (AMF), which is inspired from the collaborative  filtering model in recommender systems. Specifically, our  AMF approach extends conventional matrix factorization into an  online, accurate, and robust approach by employing techniques  of data transformation, online learning and adaptive weights.  To evaluate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted  based on a real-world large-scale QoS dataset of Web services,  and the results show the high performance of our approach in  terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Additionally, a case  study on a prototype application demonstrates the benefit of our  QoS prediction approach for runtime service adaptation.</p>  Read more about our paper: [<a href="http://jimzhu.github.io/pub/jmzhu_icdcs2014.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a>][<a href="http://jimzhu.github.io/pub/jmzhu_icdcs2014_slides.pptx" target="_blank">Slides</a>]  <br><br>  <h2>Dataset Release</h2>  <p>The main goal of this dataset is to offer real-world data for future research. We have collected 4,500 Web services from the Internet. 142 distributed computers from Planet-Lab have been employed as service users to evaluate the QoS performance of Web services over 64 time slices (15 minute interval).</p>  <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jmzhu/dataset/wsrec_dataset2.zip" class="button">       <small>Download</small>       dataset     </a>  This data package includes:<br>  1.
