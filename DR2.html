However,  as applications are migrated to the cloud and deployed across a  wide-area network, the application latency usually presents high  variability over time. Among lots of subtleties that inﬂuence  the latency, one important factor is relying on the Internet  for application connectivity, which introduces a high degree of  variability and uncertainty on user-perceived application latency.  As a result, a key challenge faced by application designers is how  to build consistently low-latency cloud applications with the large  number of geo-distributed and latency-varying cloud components.  In this paper, we propose a dynamic request routing framework,  DR<sup>2</sup>, by taking full advantage of redundant components in  the clouds to tolerate latency variability. In practice, many  functionally-equivalent components have been already deployed  redundantly for load balancing and fault tolerance, thus resulting  in low additional overhead for DR<sup>2</sup>. To evaluate the performance  of our approach, we conduct a set of experiments based on two  large-scale real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset. The results  show the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our approach.  <br><br>  Read more about our paper: [<a href="http://jiemingzhu.github.io/pub/jmzhu_cloud2013.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a>][<a href="http://jiemingzhu.github.io/pub/jmzhu_cloud2013_slides.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a>]  <br><br>   <h2>Dataset </h2>  <p>This dataset is collected via the PlanetLab platform in Jan. 2012, comprising two data matrix Lu and Ls. In our experiments, we take the 460 PlanetLab nodes as the hosts of services, and the 1,350 IPs as the users. We measure the latency between each other by continously ping 10 times at a interval of 1ms, and take the median as the result. Thus, the latencies between 1,350 users and 460 services (Lu) and also between the 460 services (Ls) are obtained. The unit of each value is millisecond. Please refer to our paper for more information on the dataset collection.</p>  <a href="http://wsdream.github.io/dataset/cloud2013_dataset" class="button">       <small>Download</small>       dataset     </a>  The dataset package includes:<br>  1. "Lu" (4.58 M): This file is a 1350-by-460 data matrix, comprising latencies between 1,350 users and 460 services.<br>  2. "Ls" (1.55 M): This file is a 460-by-460 data matrix, comprising latencies between 460 services. This matrix is asymmetric, since the latency from a to b and latency from b to a may be different due to the routing policy.<br>  3.
